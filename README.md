# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is a datset containing information on every NASCAR race run from 1975 to 2003. It contains 10 variables including the driver's name, starting and finishing positions, their payout, car make, etc. There is an accompanying dataset that contains information on each track (such as length and track type) that joins this dataset via a composite key, and would allow for further visualizations and interactivity. 
Here is a link to the driver dataset: https://gist.github.com/rgjohnson98/1adb1e0d401abab38e1d294ac70f547e

## Prototypes

Thus far, I have two prototype visualizations. The first is this scatterplot showing the finishing positions of each car make throughout the 28 years shown in this dataset. As we can see, neither Plymouth nor Chrysler won any races during that time, but all others have won at least once.

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments, and link to them)

You can make images into links like this:

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * (insert your question or task here) How does the X vary over time?
 * (insert your question or task here) Is there any correlation between X and Y?
 * (insert your question or task here) Are there interesting spatial patterns in X?
 * (insert your question or task here) How many X are there across different Y?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)
